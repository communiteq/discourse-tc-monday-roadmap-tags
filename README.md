There are four special tags and they belong to a tag group which can only be set by staff (if you have another group for that, that will work too), and only one at a time.
These tags are not part of the theme component and should be added manually, at `/tag_groups`

The names of the tags should be:
* released
* planned
* not-planned
* not-on-roadmap

These four tags are put on a separate line, both in the topic lists but also in the topic view, and are expanded to a text in a certain color.
